    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil or to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup fresh spinach, rinsed and dried</li>
      <li>8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pizza crust on

        In a small bowl, mix together olive oil and sesame oil. Brush onto
